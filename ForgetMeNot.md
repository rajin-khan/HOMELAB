## üß± FILE STRUCTURE (Custom Setup)

```bash
/Users/rajin/Media/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Movies/         # Where Radarr stores organized movie files | Where Jellyfin retrieves Movies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TV Shows/       # Where Sonarr stores organized TV files | Where Jellyfin retrieves Shows
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Downloads/      # Where Transmission saves new downloads temporarily, moves them to the Jellyfin Media folders later
```

6. **Start Uptime Kuma**

   * Run: `pm2 start uptime-kuma` (if using pm2)
   * Or: `cd uptime-kuma && node server/server.js`
   * Visit [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

7. **Start Tailscale (optional)**

## üîÑ WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I ADD A SHOW OR MOVIE?

### üì∫ Sonarr Workflow (TV Shows)

1. I go to `http://localhost:8989`
2. Click **Add New Series**
3. Choose a show, select `/Users/rajin/Media/TV Shows` as folder
4. It auto-finds episodes via indexers from **Prowlarr**
5. Transmission downloads it
6. Sonarr moves/renames the file to `TV Shows/ShowName/...`
7. Jellyfin sees it automatically

### üé¨ Radarr Workflow (Movies)

1. I go to `http://localhost:7878`
2. Click **Add New Movie**
3. Choose movie, folder = `/Users/rajin/Media/Movies`
4. Radarr sends download to Transmission
5. Once complete, it moves file and notifies Jellyfin, which sees it automatically, just like Sonarr

---

### üåê Prowlarr Workflow (Indexer Management)

1. I go to `http://localhost:9696`
2. I add indexers (e.g., Nyaa, TPB, RARBG, TorrentDownloads, Torrentsome, TorrentTip, YTS)
3. Prowlarr automatically syncs these with Sonarr and Radarr
4. When I search for shows or movies in Sonarr/Radarr, results are pulled through Prowlarr
5. It acts as a unified backend for **indexer search, RSS, and management**

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK TIPS

| Problem                           | What to Do                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Jellyfin shows nothing            | Check that files are in `/Movies` or `/TV Shows`, and Jellyfin libraries are set to those  |
| Transmission not downloading      | Make sure it's running, check port settings, or test torrents manually                     |
| Sonarr/Radarr not finding content | Check indexers in **Prowlarr**, make sure they're enabled and properly synced              |
| Remote access fails               | Run `tailscale up`, check `tailscale status`, run Tailscale and check correct Tailscale IP |
| Uptime Kuma not monitoring       | Check monitors are configured with correct API URLs (include apikey parameter)             |
| Services show offline in Kuma    | Verify service URLs and API keys, restart Uptime Kuma with `pm2 restart uptime-kuma`      |
| Subtitle missing                  | Install **Bazarr** and point it to the same folders (work on this later)                        |
| Automated tasks not running     | Check cron logs (`~/cron_homelab.log`), verify schedule (`crontab -l`), and script permissions (`chmod +x`) |
